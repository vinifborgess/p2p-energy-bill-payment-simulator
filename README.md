# Simulated P2P payment using Solidity and MetaMask
Business interaction of customers of an electricity distributor interacting when paying a simulated bill using MetaMask. 

The project will allow a demo customer to pay an energy bill directly to the energy provider through cryptocurrencies (e.g. ETH), using a MetaMask wallet and smart contracts. This transaction takes place in a decentralized manner, without the need for financial intermediaries such as banks or traditional payment systems.
